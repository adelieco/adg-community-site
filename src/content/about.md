The goal of the Adelie Developer's Group is to give its members a _"100-hour head start"_ of sorts. To help developers navigate their first few dozen steps in the field, and to provide a place where beginners could ask questions completely unhibited by the social and technical restrictions that exist in many other beginner forums (e.g. StackOverflow, Reddit).

Since its inception more than a year ago, it's also become a place for intermediate/advanced developers to discuss more difficult topics and share resources. Membership is currently capped at 40 **active** spots.
