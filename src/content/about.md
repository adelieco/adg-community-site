title: "A global web-development study collective"

Hi, I'm Kevin. I'm a front-end developer & coordinator of this group, which began inviting its first members around March of 2017. I knew I wasn't a seasoned veteran by any means, but I did know my way around the resources online. Coding is absolutely a field that can be self-taught, but admittedly, a lot of the time I spent "studying" was actually me wasting away, sifting through outdated or irrelevant resources. I didn't know what I didn't know, and the learning process felt like trouble-shooting, rather than an enriching experience. The goal of the Adelie Developer's Group, while a bit more nuanced nowadays, has always chiefly been to give its members a "100-hour head start."

At its inception, the Adelie Developer's Group was intended to be a group where beginners could ask questions completely unhibited by the restrictions that exist in many other beginner forums like StackOverflow and Reddit. 



Membership is intentionally hard-capped at around 30. Many Slack and Discord groups spring up all the time, but often collapse under the weight of the hype.
